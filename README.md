# kea-dev/social-coding

**This repo is used to offer assignments (exercises) in GitHub Classroom related to the module ["Social Coding"](https://docs.kea.dev/posts/social-coding/) which - as always - you will find a [docs.kea.dev](https://docs.kea.dev)**

If you have any questions feel free to join the [discussion ðŸ’¬ @ kea-dev](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dev/discussions)

# How to get started

After you have acceptet the assignment in GitHub Classroom, you will need to initialize it by importing the issues from the template. While located in the root of the repo run the following command in a terminal:

```
.github/template/cpissues.sh
```

The command will create a series of issues in your own repo - simply get cracking at 'em - work those issues!
